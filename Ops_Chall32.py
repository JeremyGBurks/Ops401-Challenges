# Purpose - User selects an OS, then recursively scans each file and folder in the user input directory path and print it to the screen.
#Generate the fileâ€™s MD5 hash using Hashlib, assign the MD5 hash to a variable. Print the variable to the screen along with a timestamp, file name, file size, and complete file path
